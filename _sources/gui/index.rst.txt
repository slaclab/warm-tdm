The Warm TDM system provides a local readout GUI for interacting with the API interface in a way
which allows for ease of use. This interface may be adopted by the official DAQ if deemed appropriate. The
variable and command interfaces provided via the GUI interface follow the API as defined in the reset of
this documentation.
