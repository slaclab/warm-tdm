.. Warm TDM documentation master file

======================================
Welcome to the Warm TDM documentation!
======================================

This is currently a work in progress.

This document is broken into three main sections. The first describes the software interface between the core Warm TDM software and the
various clients which interface to it.

The second section describes the structure of the managed elements in the Warm TDM core, providing detailed information of the
data contained and how it should be accessed.

Finally the Warm TDM GUI interface is described. This GUI interface is designed as a users interface to the API, witht he same managed elements.
